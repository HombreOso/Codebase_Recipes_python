            "Feed the first jar with 25g strong white flour, 25g wholemeal flour and 50ml water, mix and loosely cover. Leave for 24 hours at room temperature. You should start to see some bubbles forming the next day.",
            "Repeat steps 3 and 4 over the next 5 days. Start putting an elastic band around your jar just after feeding so you can track how much the starter is growing during the 24-hour period. Keep the jars covered loosely as if they're too tight, the pressure may force the glass to over expand and crack.",
            "By the end of the week it should be nice and active with the mixture roughly doubling in size. By this time your starter will be ready to bake with.",
            "To build the leaven: In a large bowl, put in 20g of the starter mixture. Feed the original starter as usual following steps 3 and 4 and store it as normal ready for next time.",
            "With the starter mixture in the bowl, add 20g strong white flour, 20g wholemeal flour and 40ml filtered water, then mix. This is what will be used the next day. Loosely cover and store at room temperature overnight.",
            "To autolyse the bread: The next day, mix the 450g strong white flour and 50g wholemeal flour together with 320ml of water (hold back the other 30ml) by hand until the flour has been fully incorporated.",
            "Place the poppy seeds and the linseeds in a bowl and cover with the 100ml boiling water. Set aside.",
            "Leave both for 30 minutes.",
            "Mix the salt with the remaining 30ml of water",
            "Add the sourdough leaven, seed mix and the salt mixture to the dough mix. Mix by hand well, kneading the mixture for 3 minutes. It will be a bit sticky. Cover and allow to rest for 15 minutes.",
            "Return to the mixture, scrape it out on to a work surface and begin to \u201cSlap and Fold\u201d the mixture by picking it up (wet hands make this easier) and with a little force, slapping it onto the work surface. Then let go and fold it over itself. This helps to build the gluten strength. After 3 minutes the dough will tighten up. Return it to the mixing bowl and cover. Store it in a warm place.",
            "After 40 minutes, repeat the \"Slap and Fold\" technique 4 or 5 times, just enough to tighten the dough back up into a ball and then return to the bowl and cover. Repeat this step 3 more times.",
            "When the dough is roughly double in size, pinch a bit of the dough and stretch it with two fingers. The dough should stretch without ripping and you should be able to roughly see through the dough. This is called the \u201cwindow pane test\u201d and indicates that we have reached the right level of fermentation and strength building in our dough.",
            "Add the dough to an uncovered worksurface and with a dough scraper, shape it into a tight ball. Dust with flour and leave for 30 minutes.",
            "Return to the dough, shape it as you like ensuring plenty of tension is retained. Add to a banneton (see tips and information section) and refrigerate for 6\u201318 hours.",
            "Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C/gas mark 7.",
            "Remove the load from the fridge, turn onto a baking parchment and score the top. Add your loaf to a Dutch oven, adding a couple of ice cubes. If you don't have a Dutch oven any oven proof dish with a lid will do.",
            "Bake for 20 minutes, remove the lid and turn the heat down to 200\u00b0C/gas mark 6.",
            "Bake for another 20 minutes or until done until golden brown. Add to a wire rack and cool.Tips and Information:  \u00b7 To keep the main sourdough starter going, you need to feed it with new flour and water every day. \u00b7 When you feed the main starter, you also need to discard some of the fully-fermented mixture in the jar to prevent the acidity and volume of starter from building up too much. This second batch can be used for other recipes or discarded if not needed.   \u00b7 If you plan to keep it at room temperature, you will need to feed it daily in order for it to stay healthy \u2013 by following steps 3 and 4 above. \u00b7If you\u2019re not baking daily, you can store your starter in the fridge: After feeding the starter following steps 3 and 4, wait one hour to allow the starter to activate then place it in the fridge. It will be fine for up to 3 weeks in the fridge without a feed. \u00b7 When you want to use the starter again, take it out of the fridge, leave it for an hour then follow steps 3 and 4 before leaving it at room temperature for 12-24 hours. If the starter has been in the fridge for a while, it can become sluggish to regrow. Simple follow steps 3 and 4, 2 or 3 times to supercharge it back to life! If it\u2019s nice, bubbly and has double in size, then it is ready to bake.  \u00b7 A banneton is a type of basket used to give bread a crisper texture during proofing, as it absorbs some of the moisture off the surface. If you don't have one, any bowl of similar shape and size will do."

            "Serve with dairy-free yogurt, a generous grind of black pepper and a few herbs. I used nasturtium from my garden which has a wonderful peppery taste.Notes  For a wintery version of this soup swap out the parsley and basil for thyme and rosemary. The chickpeas act as a thickening agent, you can substitute them with 2 tbsp nuts such as cashews. Peas can be substituted with broad beans or edamame. Be sure to use white miso for this recipe as dark miso would change the lovely bright green of the soup."

Add the ground walnuts, lentils, tinned tomatoes, tomato puree, red wine, chilli flakes, oregano, thyme, balsamic vinegar, yeast extract and water. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent the sauce catching. It will look grey at first, but will darken as it cooks. Once the sauce has darkened in colour and thickened considerably, taste and season to perfection with salt and pepper.",
            "While the ragu is simmering, cook your pasta. Put the saucepan on the hob. Pour the boiling water from the kettle into the saucepan. Turn the heat right up. Sprinkle in a generous pinch of salt. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, following the instructions on the packet. Remove a quarter cup of the starchy pasta cooking water and reserve. Drain the pasta in a colander. Add the cooked spaghetti and a splash of the pasta water to the ragu in the pan and stir through. Grate the hard cheese (if using) and chop the parsley leaves. Plate up the spaghetti and ragu, garnish with parsley (and thyme, if using fresh leaves) and serve immediately with green salad."

You should pour in enough that it comes up by 1.5cm in the pan. Heat up the oil. To check it is hot enough, just put in a tiny bit of leftover falafel mixture. When it starts bubbling, you are good to go. Place your falafels in the pan, and cook for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until each side is brown and crisp. When ready, remove falafels from the pan and place on some kitchen paper. Put some kitchen paper on top of them, and pat off the oil.",
            "Assembly time. Warm your pittas. Layer one side with a generous helping of hummus. Spoon in some of the salad. Then, take your baked or fried falafels and break them into the pittas \u2013 squeeze in 4 or 5 discs into each one. Put some pickled green chillies on top, then spoon over a bit more hummus.
